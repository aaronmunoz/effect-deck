# Active Context: Effect Deck

*Last Updated: 2025-06-27*

## Current Work Focus

**Primary Objective**: Initialize and establish proper Memory Bank structure for ongoing development continuity.

**Current Status**: Memory Bank initialization complete - all core files created with comprehensive project context.

## Recent Changes

### Memory Bank Structure Established
- Added Memory Bank documentation to CLAUDE.md with flowchart and workflows
- Created all 6 core memory bank files:
  - `projectbrief.md` - Foundation requirements and scope
  - `productContext.md` - User experience and value propositions  
  - `systemPatterns.md` - Architecture and design patterns
  - `techContext.md` - Technology stack and development setup
  - `activeContext.md` - Current focus and recent changes
  - `progress.md` - Implementation status and next steps

### Project Analysis Completed
- Comprehensive comparison of EffectDeckProposal.md vs current implementation
- Status assessment: 15-20% of original ambitious proposal completed
- Identified critical gaps: testing framework, CI/CD, web interface

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities (Current Session)
1. **Complete Memory Bank Setup** - Finish `progress.md` with current implementation status
2. **Validate Memory Bank Structure** - Ensure all files provide complete context for future Claude instances

### Short-term Development Goals (Next 1-2 weeks)
1. **Testing Infrastructure** - Implement Mocha + Chai + @effect/test framework
2. **CI/CD Pipeline** - Add GitHub Actions for automated testing and builds  
3. **Web Interface Foundation** - Begin React implementation to replace stub

### Medium-term Goals (1-2 months)
1. **Game Content Expansion** - Add more cards, enemies, encounters
2. **Advanced Effect Patterns** - Implement proper Context/Layer usage
3. **Save System** - Add game persistence functionality

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Memory Bank as Primary Context
- **Decision**: Use Memory Bank as single source of truth for project context
- **Rationale**: Claude's memory resets require perfect documentation for continuity
- **Implementation**: All project understanding flows through Memory Bank files

### Functional-First Architecture
- **Maintained**: Effect-TS patterns throughout codebase
- **Current**: Basic Effect usage in game engine
- **Goal**: Demonstrate advanced Effect composition patterns

### Testing Strategy Pivot
- **Issue**: Zero tests currently exist (vs user requirement of 90% coverage)
- **Decision**: Testing infrastructure is highest priority
- **Approach**: Start with core game engine unit tests, expand to integration

### Web Interface Approach
- **Current**: Placeholder stub only
- **Decision**: Build React interface that matches CLI functionality
- **Strategy**: Reuse core game engine, create parallel UI implementation

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Code Quality Standards
- Strict TypeScript with exact optional properties
- No thrown exceptions - all errors as Effect failures
- Immutable state updates with pure functions
- Comprehensive test coverage for all new code

### Effect-TS Usage Patterns
- `Effect.gen` for sequential operations
- `Ref` for mutable state within Effect context
- Schema validation at package boundaries
- Structured error types with meaningful messages

### Development Workflow
- Monorepo with clear package boundaries
- Core engine completely UI-agnostic
- JSON responses suitable for any frontend
- Nx for build orchestration and caching

## Learnings and Project Insights

### What Works Well
- **Functional CLI Game**: Current implementation is actually playable and enjoyable
- **Clean Architecture**: Monorepo structure with proper separation works well
- **Effect-TS Integration**: Core patterns are sound and extensible
- **Developer Experience**: Nx tooling provides good development workflow

### Critical Gaps Identified
- **Testing Infrastructure**: Biggest blocker to professional-grade development
- **Documentation Gap**: Need to bridge 85% implementation gap from proposal
- **Web Interface**: Major deliverable completely missing
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: No automation for quality gates or deployment

### Key Insights
- Current implementation is solid foundation, not complete product
- Original proposal was extremely ambitious for timeline
- Focus should be on quality over scope expansion
- Memory Bank structure is essential for Claude continuity

## Decision Context

### Why Memory Bank Matters
Claude's memory resets completely between sessions. Without comprehensive documentation, each session starts from zero understanding. The Memory Bank ensures:
- Complete project context preservation
- Consistent development patterns
- Continuity of architectural decisions
- Efficient onboarding for future sessions

### Current Development Philosophy
- **Quality over quantity**: Better to have fewer features that work perfectly
- **Test-driven development**: No new features without tests
- **Documentation-driven**: All decisions captured in Memory Bank
- **Effect-first thinking**: Demonstrate functional programming throughout
