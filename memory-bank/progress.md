# Progress: Effect Deck

*Last Updated: 2025-06-27*

## What Works

### âœ… Functional CLI Game (80% Complete)
- **Complete game loop**: Turn-based combat with win/lose conditions
- **Interactive UI**: Rich terminal interface with inquirer prompts
- **Card system**: 15 playable cards with varied effects
- **Game mechanics**: Energy system, shield, damage, contexts
- **Effect integration**: Core game logic uses Effect-TS patterns properly

### âœ… Core Game Engine (70% Complete)
- **Immutable state**: All game state changes return new objects
- **Schema validation**: Effect Schema for all game data structures
- **JSON responses**: API suitable for any frontend implementation
- **Error handling**: Structured errors using Effect failures
- **Turn management**: Phase-based system with proper transitions

### âœ… Monorepo Architecture (75% Complete)
- **Nx workspace**: Properly configured with TypeScript preset
- **Package structure**: Core/CLI/Web packages with clear boundaries
- **Path mapping**: TypeScript aliases for clean imports
- **Build system**: Functional builds across all packages
- **Code quality**: ESLint + Prettier with Git hooks

### âœ… TypeScript Excellence (90% Complete)
- **Strict configuration**: exactOptionalPropertyTypes, strictNullChecks
- **Type safety**: No any types, comprehensive typing
- **Effect types**: Proper Effect<Success, Error> throughout
- **Schema types**: Runtime validation with compile-time safety

## What's Left to Build

### ðŸ”§ Testing Infrastructure (0% Complete)
**Priority: Critical - Blocks professional development**
- Unit tests for core game engine functions
- Integration tests for package interactions
- E2E tests for complete game flows
- Effect testing utilities setup
- 90% coverage requirement (per user's coding rules)

**Implementation Plan**:
- Set up Mocha + Chai + @effect/test in core package
- Create test fixtures for common game states
- Test all card effects and game state transitions
- Add integration tests for CLI game flows

### ðŸ”§ CI/CD Pipeline (0% Complete)
**Priority: High - Enables automated quality gates**
- GitHub Actions workflow for testing
- Automated builds on PR/push
- ESLint and Prettier checks
- Test coverage reporting
- Automated npm publishing setup

**Implementation Plan**:
- Create `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- Run `nx affected` commands for changed packages
- Enforce quality gates before merging
- Set up branch protection rules

### ðŸ”§ Web Interface (5% Complete)
**Priority: High - Major deliverable missing**
- React application with game UI
- Drag-and-drop card playing
- Real-time game state visualization
- Responsive design for desktop/tablet
- Feature parity with CLI interface

**Implementation Plan**:
- Replace web package stub with React setup
- Create shared UI components for cards/game board
- Implement drag-and-drop interactions
- Add animations for effect resolution

### ðŸ”§ Game Content Expansion (30% Complete)
**Priority: Medium - Enhances gameplay**
- Additional card types and effects
- Multiple enemy types with different behaviors
- Encounter generation system
- Card upgrade mechanics
- Achievement/progression system

**Implementation Plan**:
- Add 10+ new cards with complex interactions
- Create 3-5 enemy types with unique AI patterns
- Implement procedural encounter generation
- Add card rarity and upgrade systems

### ðŸ”§ Advanced Effect Patterns (40% Complete)
**Priority: Medium - Demonstrates Effect-TS capabilities**
- Context/Layer dependency injection
- Complex effect composition
- Advanced error recovery patterns
- Performance optimization with Effect

**Implementation Plan**:
- Refactor game engine to use Context/Layer patterns
- Create composable effect chains for card interactions
- Implement sophisticated error handling strategies
- Add observability with Effect.withSpan

## Current Status Assessment

### Implementation Completeness: 15-20%
The current project represents a **solid foundation** rather than a complete MVP. Key areas:

**Strong Foundation**:
- Core architecture is sound and extensible
- CLI game is actually playable and enjoyable
- Effect-TS integration demonstrates good patterns
- TypeScript configuration meets professional standards

**Critical Missing Infrastructure**:
- Zero tests (vs required 90% coverage)
- No CI/CD pipeline
- Web interface is completely missing
- Limited game content and mechanics

### Quality vs Scope Trade-offs

**Current Approach: Quality Foundation**
- What exists works well and follows good patterns
- Code is clean, typed, and maintainable
- Architecture supports future expansion

**Original Proposal: Ambitious Scope**
- 6-8 week comprehensive MVP plan
- Multiple frontend implementations
- Full deployment and distribution strategy
- Extensive testing and documentation

**Gap Analysis**: ~85% of original scope remains unimplemented

## Known Issues

### Technical Debt
1. **Testing Gap**: No automated testing despite user requirement for 90% coverage
2. **Web Stub**: Package exists but contains only placeholder code
3. **Limited Error Types**: Basic string errors vs structured error types
4. **Save System**: No game persistence or save/load functionality

### Development Process Issues
1. **No Automation**: Manual testing and quality checks
2. **Missing Documentation**: API docs and developer guides incomplete
3. **No Deployment**: Packages not published or deployed anywhere
4. **Limited CI**: No automated builds or quality gates

### Game Design Limitations
1. **Single Enemy**: Only one enemy type vs planned variety
2. **Basic Cards**: Limited card interactions and complexity
3. **No Progression**: No meta-progression or deck building
4. **Static Content**: No procedural generation

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Original Vision (EffectDeckProposal.md)
- Comprehensive 6-8 week MVP with multiple phases
- Full ecosystem with web, CLI, and server packages
- Extensive testing, CI/CD, and deployment infrastructure
- 20+ cards, 10+ enemies, complex effect interactions

### Current Reality (2025-06-27)
- Functional but limited CLI game (1-2 weeks of work)
- Basic monorepo structure with one working package
- Good architectural foundation but missing critical infrastructure
- Playable game that demonstrates core concepts

### Lessons Learned
1. **Scope Management**: Original proposal was extremely ambitious
2. **Quality Focus**: Better to have fewer features that work perfectly
3. **Infrastructure First**: Testing and CI/CD should be established early
4. **Iterative Development**: Build working foundation, then expand

### Path Forward
1. **Immediate**: Complete testing infrastructure and CI/CD setup
2. **Short-term**: Build web interface to match CLI functionality
3. **Medium-term**: Expand game content and advanced Effect patterns
4. **Long-term**: Work toward original comprehensive vision

## Next Session Priorities

1. **Complete Memory Bank**: Ensure all context is documented
2. **Testing Setup**: Implement test framework in core package
3. **CI/CD Foundation**: Create GitHub Actions workflow
4. **Web Interface**: Begin React implementation

The project has a solid foundation and demonstrates good Effect-TS patterns. The focus should be on filling critical infrastructure gaps before expanding game content.
